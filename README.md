# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
The top file is the "master" file, implementing the other files and utilizing them for some purpose.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
The constraints file determines which switches, LEDs, and other parts of the board are able to be utilized by the other files.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
Both were correct. For part A, Minterms would have been much easier to determine. Part B worked well with minterms, however.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
For each bit, you would use an additional full-adder.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The XOR gate allows the adder to carry a value when both added inputs are 1.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number a two bit adder can handle is 6, as when adding 3 + 3 (11 + 11), the result is 6 (110), 
as 1 + 1 gives us a carryout of 1 and a value of 0. So in the 1's place, you get 0, and in the 2's place, you get 1 (1 + 1 + 1 = 1 and carryout 1), 
the final carryout ending in the 4's place, giving us 4 + 2 = 6.

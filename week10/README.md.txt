Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?
The combinatorial loop causes an error that Verilog will not run with.
What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?
This creates a list of all signals read within the sensitivity block.
What importance is memory to digital circuits?
It is important for retaining inputs and information, allowing for a continuation from the output in the future.

## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
Level sensitive circuits read input the entire up-clockcycle while edge sensitive circuits only read either the positive or negative edge at a time.

### Why is it important to declare initial state?
If it is not declared, then the latch will not have an input to start with and would not work.

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
They let us build dlatches and different flipflops.

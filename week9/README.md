## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
A multiplexer allows for multiple inputs to be taken and a specific output to be given depending on the inputs.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
A demultiplexer allows for multiple different outputs depending on one input from a multiplexer.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
These circuits can allow us to simplify functions by reducing the number of input variables.
